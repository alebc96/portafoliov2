        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
        <p>When I decided to study computer engineering, I discovered a fascinating and enjoyable world where boredom is not an option. There is so much to learn that it would be impossible to cover it all. I chose to focus on web development as I am fascinated by the internet and the technologies surrounding it. Since graduation, I have worked on some freelance projects and at the company where I served as a developer. However, my eagerness to learn brought me to the other side of the world, and here I am in Spain, learning day by day. :D</p>
